## Summary 
The report employs various predictive algorithms and models to minimize the risk of giving bad loans and refusing good loans. Logistic regression with Reduced Variables using Python’s recursive feature elimination and oversampled bad loans proved to be the most appropriate model with the lowest cost matrix score. Random forest with reduced variables and oversampled bad loans had the highest F1 score overall in 20 Fold cross-validation. However, random forest performed rather poorly for test-on-test data. Given Logistic regression’s superiority to other models in 70:30 Random Sampling and repeat testing hundred times, this report concludes Reduced variable Logistic Regression to be the most appropriate model. A 93% Kaggle Score achieved through this model further supports this conclusion.
